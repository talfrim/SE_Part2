**Few notes for the second part**
1. The output path needs to contain the output path used for pre-proccessing the corpus.
2. The stemming checkbox should fit the setting chosen in the pre-proccessing.
3. Semantically similar words: it is *not necessary* to have a working internet connection, but it is recommended for better results.



Enjoy!
